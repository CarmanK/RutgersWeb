                <p id="about_me_para">I am a senior student at Elizabethtown College majoring in both Computer Engineering and Computer Science. I recently finished conducting undergraduate research at Rutgers University focused on algorithmically developing 'Graph Stories.' More information on that can be found in the 'Research' tab! I am currently seeking an entry-level position in Software Engineering. In the near future, after I establish myself in the industry, I plan to pursue a Master's Degree in either of my majors. Aside from academics, my hobbies include playing basketball, tasting unique foods, and woodworking.</p>
