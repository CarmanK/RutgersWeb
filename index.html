            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>    Graph stories are a way to efficiently and effectively extract information and data from large graphs. When working with large graphs of data, sometimes with millions if not billions of edges and vertices, it would be nonsensical to look at the raw graph and try to make sense of it. The approach Dr. James Abello took was to first decompose the graph into layers so that it would be both visually appealing and organized. To accomplish this, he used what is called the peeling algorithm. A simple explanation of this algorithm is that it iteratively strips away the vertices of the graph based on their degree. Once the graph has been completely processed by the algorithm, we are left with layers that act as a partition of edges. It is important to note that the end result is not a partition of vertices; however, because the vertices can be cloned in the algorithm which end up creating interesting connections between the various layers. So now, with the graph decomposed, the next step is visualization and exploration. <a href="https://fredhohman.com/papers/atlas">Atlas</a> is an open-source project created by Dr. James Abello and his team that runs in-browser and allows users to explore and interpret graphs. There is an extension currently being worked on called Graph Waves which will have even more functionality than Atlas and will be able to handle the larger fixed point graphs that Atlas struggles with. So where do I fit in to this project? My goal is to analyze the metadata of the fixed point graphs with the goal of algorithmically building a 'story' that summarizes the data. Finally, I need to develop a medium to present the 'story' to the user.</p>

                <h4>Week 1</h4>
                <p>This week started with moving in and getting acquainted with both the Rutgers campus and everyone involved with the DIMACS REU program. After orientation, I met my mentor and got an in-depth explanation of the current state of the project I will be working on. This really helped me understand what my project was about and how I will be contributing to it. I spent much of the week reading up on graph theory and other related research. I met the other two graduate students involved with this project on Friday and got to see the newest build of Atlas. Over the weekend, I was able to play around with the build and I documented my new user experience to aid the development of the project. We had our introductory presentations today, and it was interesting to learn about all of the other student's projects.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="week2" class="tabcontent">
                <h4>Week 2</h4>
                <p>I met with my mentor after the presentations to learn more about the algorithm we are using. This second part of the algorithm focuses on graph waves. He again explained the entire process very clearly. I mainly worked on analyzing small and common fixed point structures this week to start thinking of 'mini-stories'. On top of this, I was introduced to AutoPhrase. AutoPhrase is a program made to determine the important phrases in a given text with little to no human intervention. We talked about how we could incorporate the functionality of this program into my task of developing graph stories. One of the datasets that we are working with is a database of proteins. Each vertex in the graph is associated with a webpage containing information about it. We plan to look into ways to scrape the associated webpages for information, then use AutoPhrase to help us determine the useful information to eventually develop graph stories.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="week3" class="tabcontent">
                <h4>Week 3</h4>
                <p>This week started off with manually combing through the data associated with our protein graph to find connections and build a summary. The purpose of this was to get an idea of how to start doing it algorithmically and of how complex it can be. The next day, I had a conference call with my mentor, a graduate CS student involved in the project named Haodong, and a future Rutgers professor named Jingbo Shang. Jingbo discussed with us how his project, AutoPhrase, could be used to help create stories for the fixed points. AutoPhrase analyzes text and determines how words come together to create phrases, then ranks the phrases based on their contexual importance accordingly. Haodong and I then began working together to develop a way to algorithmically create these stories. I started off by writing a website scraper in Python to gather both the title and abstract associated with each protein. Haodong then ran the PubMed papers I gathered through an algorithm to calculate their TF-IDF scores and selected the top-k, 10 in this case, phrases. We then used a tool called Elasticsearch to index nearly 20,000 various PubMed abstracts. This was a very small subset of the PubMed abstracts we obtained because it was very slow to index them, and the more we had, the longer and more complex our querying then had to be. We also wanted to make sure that we had a working proof of concept first before diving into bigger datasets. After the abstracts were indexed, we queried every possible pair of phrases and kept the top-k, in this case 10 again, articles from the query to create a massive pool of relevant articles. Lastly, we iterated through each sentence in the pool and computed the TF-IDF scores along with how many new phrases the sentence covered until all pairs of phrases had been covered or the maximum number of sentences was reached. We have some work left to do, but from these results we hope to have generated accurate stories for these fixed points.</p>
