            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>    Graph stories are a way to efficiently and effectively extract information and data from large graphs. When working with large graphs of data, sometimes with millions if not billions of edges and vertices, it would be nonsensical to look at the raw graph and try to make sense of it. The approach Dr. James Abello took was to first decompose the graph into layers so that it would be both visually appealing and organized. To accomplish this, he used what is called the peeling algorithm. A simple explanation of this algorithm is that it iteratively strips away the vertices of the graph based on their degree. Once the graph has been completely processed by the algorithm, we are left with layers that act as a partition of edges. It is important to note that the end result is not a partition of vertices; however, because the vertices can be cloned in the algorithmn which end up creating interesting connections between the various layers. So now, with the graph decomposed, the next step is visualization and exploration. <a href="https://fredhohman.com/papers/atlas">Atlas</a> is an open-source project created by Dr. James Abello and his team that runs in-browser and allows users to explore and interpret graphs. There is an extension currently being worked on called Graph Waves which will have even more functionality than Atlas and will be able to handle the larger fixed point graphs that Atlas struggles with. So where do I fit in to this project? My goal is to analyze the metadata of the fixed point graphs with the goal of algorithmically building a 'story' that summarizes the data. Finally, I need to develop a medium to present the 'story' to the user.</p>

            <h3>Weekly Log</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Week 1:</dt>
                <dd>This week started with moving in and getting acquainted with both the Rutgers campus and everyone involved with the DIMACS REU program. After orientation, I met my mentor and got an in-depth explanation of the current state of the project I will be working on. This really helped me understand what my project was about and how I will be contributing to it. I spent much of the week reading up on graph theory and other related research. I met the other two graduate students involved with this project on Friday and got to see the newest build of Atlas. Over the weekend, I was able to play around with the build and I documented my new user experience to aid the development of the project. We had our introductory presentations today, and it was interesting to learn about all of the other student's projects.</dd>
