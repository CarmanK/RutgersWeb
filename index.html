                <p id="about_me_para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I begin my exciting career at Lockheed Martin as an Associate Software Engineer, I am proud to look back on all the hard work I have dedicated to my passion over the last few years and am eternally grateful for all the connections I have made along the way. I just recently graduated from Elizabethtown College with two Bachelor's degrees, Computer Engineering and Computer Science, and managed to graduate with the highest Latin honor, Summa cum laude, with a staggering cumulative GPA of 3.90. I still have plans to pursue a Master's Degree in Computer Science, but would like to take a gap year before continuing my education in order to establish myself in industry. Aside from academics, my hobbies include playing basketball, tasting unique foods, and woodworking.</p>
